******************
About Certificates
******************

EdX currently offers the following types of certificates.

* :ref:`Verified track certificates<SFD Verified Certificates>` for single
  courses.

* :ref:`Program certificates<SFD XSeries Certificates>` for a program, or series
  of courses, such as a MicroMasters or Professional Certificate program.

.. note::
  Not all courses offer certificates. In the past, edX also offered honor code
  certificates, which are no longer available. If you earned an honor code
  certificate in the past, you can still access your certificate through your
  :ref:`dashboard<SFD Learner Dashboard>`. For more information, see `News
  About edX Certificates`_.

  Additionally, some edX courses offer academic credit. The requirements and
  steps for earning certificates in these courses are different. For more
  information, see :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit`.


.. _SFD Verified Certificates:

===========================
About Verified Certificates
===========================

Most, but not all, courses on edx.org offer :ref:`verified tracks<Enroll in
the Verified Track>` of study, from which you can earn verified certificates.
For more information about the benefits of verified certificates, and to see
an example of a verified certificate, see `Verified Certificates`_. For a list
of all courses that offer verified certificates, see the `edX course
catalog`_.

To earn a verified certificate from an edX course, you enroll in or upgrade to
the verified track in the course, pay the certificate fee, :ref:`verify your
identity<SFD Verify Your Identity>` using a webcam and a photo ID, and earn a
passing grade.

Verified certificates include the following information.

* The name that you entered as your full name when you created your account.

  To verify or change your full name before your certificate is issued,
  :ref:`check your account settings<SFD Update Account Settings>`.

* The name of the course.
* The edX partner institution that created the course.
* The names and signatures of one or more members of the course team.
* The date, in universal coordinated time (UTC), when the certificate was
  issued.
* A URL that others can visit to verify the authenticity of the certificate.

.. note::
  Verified certificates do not include your final grade in the course or the
  number of credit hours that a university might offer for the course. Your
  final grade appears on your **Progress** page and on your dashboard. If you
  need a record of your grade, you can print your **Progress** page or
  dashboard.

For information about accessing a course certificate that you have earned,
see :ref:`SFD Receiving a Certificate`.


.. _SFD XSeries Certificates:

==========================
About Program Certificates
==========================

Certificates for programs (such as `MicroMasters`_, `Professional
Certificate`_, or `XSeries`_) show that you have successfully earned a
verified certificate for each course in the program.

To earn a certificate for a program, you must upgrade to the verified track
for all the courses in the program, and pass all the courses in the program
with the required grades.

For more information about enrollment tracks, see :ref:`Enrollment Tracks`.

Program certificates include the following information.

* The name that you entered as your full name when you created your account.

  To verify or change your full name before your certificate is issued,
  :ref:`check your account settings<SFD Update Account Settings>`.

* The name of the program.
* The edX partner institution that created the program.
* The names and signatures of one or more members of the program team.
* The month and year when the certificate was issued.
* A certificate ID that others can use to validate the certificate.

For information about accessing a program certificate that you have earned,
see :ref:`Receive a Certificate for a Program`.


.. _SFD Change to the Verified Track:

************************************************
Enrolling in or Upgrading to the Verified Track
************************************************

Being in the :ref:`verified track<SFD Verified Track>` of a course means that
you are eligible to receive a certificate when you pass the course with a
required grade.

Enrolling in the verified track requires that you pay for the :ref:`verified
certificate<SFD Verified Certificates>` and also that you  :ref:`verify your
identity<SFD Verify Your Identity>` using a webcam and a photo ID.

You can enroll in the verified track of a course in two ways.

* You enroll directly in the verified track of the course, if you have not yet
  enrolled in the course.

* You upgrade to the verified track, if you are already enrolled in the audit
  track for the course.

  If you are enrolled in the audit track for a course, you can upgrade to the
  verified track at any time, until the deadline for upgrading has passed. The
  deadline for upgrading to the verified track is usually about two weeks
  after the course start date.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course for which you want to find the upgrade
   deadline, and then select **View Course**.

   has your photo and full name on the same side.

To upgrade to the verified track, follow these steps.

#. On the edx.org website, select your username in the top corner of the page.

   Your dashboard opens with a list of your courses.

#. For the course for which you want to upgrade to the verified track, select
   **Upgrade to Verified Track**.

   If there is no **Upgrade to Verified Track** option, the enrollment
   deadline for the verified track has passed.

#. Follow the instructions to pay the verified track fee and verify your
   identity. For more information, see :ref:`Enroll in the Verified Track`.

After you submit your payment, you can view information about that payment at

.. _SFD_Pursue Program Certificate:

********************************
Pursuing a Program Certificate   
********************************

To pursue a program certificate, you enroll in, or upgrade to, the
:ref:`verified track<SFD Verified Track>` for each course in the program. You
earn the program certificate only if you earn a verified certificate for each
course in the program.

There are several paths you can take to pursue a program certificate.

* If you are not yet enrolled in any of the program's courses:
  - Purchase the verified track for each of the program's courses separately;
  - Purchase the verified track for all of the program's courses all at once.

* If you are already in the audit track of a course in the program:
  - Upgrade to the verified track for each course in the program separately;
  - Purchase the verified track for all courses in the program at once.

* If you are already in the verified track of one or more courses in the
  program:
  - Purchase the verified track for each remaining course separately;
  - Purchase the verified track for all remaining courses at once.


******************************
Managing Certificate Payments
******************************

After you pay to enroll in the verified track for a course, you can review
information about your payment. Within the deadline period, you can also get a
refund.

=================
Get a Refund
=================

.. important:: You can receive a refund for a certificate fee up to 14 days
   after your payment or 14 days after the course start date, whichever is
   later. After these dates pass, edX cannot provide a refund.

To get a refund for a certificate fee within the refund period, follow the steps
described in :ref:`Unenroll from a Course`.

After you unenroll, the edX support team will contact you with information
about receiving your refund.

Optionally, after you unenroll from the verified track in your course, you can
:ref:`re-enroll in the audit track<Enroll in the Audit Track>` for the course,
to take the course without a certificate option.

If you have questions about changing your enrollment track, contact the edX
support team at technical@edx.org.


.. _SFD Verify Your Identity:

******************************
Verifying Your Identity
******************************

When you enroll in the :ref:`verified track<SFD Verified Track>` for a course,
you must use a webcam to take a photograph of yourself and of a photo ID that
has your photo and full name on the same side.

You do not have to verify your identity immediately, but you must do so before
the course ID verification deadline. The deadline appears below the name of the
course on your dashboard.

To verify your identity, you use a webcam to take a photo of yourself and of a
photo ID that has your photo and full name on the same side. EdX encrypts your
photos and uses the highest levels of security available to protect your data.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

When you verify your identity on edx.org, that verification is effective for one
year, for all courses.

* If you enroll in the verified track for another course, you pay for that
  course's certificate, but you do not have to verify your identify again.

* If you enroll in a course that offers academic credit, you might have to
  verify your identity periodically during the course. For more information,
  see :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit`.

===================================
Preparing to Verify Your Identity
===================================

When you enroll in the verified track for a course, you must use a webcam to
take a photograph of yourself and of a photo ID that has your photo and name
on the same side. Before you begin the identity verification process, follow
these recommendations to make the process as straightforward as possible.

* Make sure that you have access to a webcam.

  If your computer does not have a webcam, edX recommends that you find out if
  your local library has a webcam that you can use, or that you borrow a
  friend's webcam. If you have a smartphone that has a camera, you can also
  verify your identity by visiting the following page in the smartphone's
  browser.

  https://courses.edx.org/verify_student/reverify

  You can sign in to one computer or smartphone to verify your identity, and
  then sign in to the computer that you typically use to complete the course.
  If you do not use a webcam to verify your identity, you cannot receive a
  verified certificate.

* Compare the name on your photo ID card to the full name you use in your edX
  account. Both names must match, including the type of characters used (Roman
  or non-Roman), accented characters, initials, and spelling.

  If necessary, you can update your edX account name at any time on the edX
  :ref:`account settings page<SFD Update Account Settings>`. You also have the
  opportunity to change your edX account name during the identity verification
  process.

* Make sure that your name is legible, and that your name and photo are visible
  together on the same side of the card.

  If your name and your photo are on two different pages, or on the front and
  back of a single page, you can copy both pages onto a single piece of paper.
  Make sure that your name is legible in the copy.

* Make sure that you can adjust the lighting for the photographs.

  For the webcam to focus, there needs to be enough light on your face and your
  ID. You might need to change the position or brightness of a lamp, or change
  your position, to improve the lighting for the photographs.

=========================
Verify Your Identity
=========================

To verify your identity, follow these steps.

#. Make sure that you have a webcam and a photo ID available.

#. Start the verification process by completing one of the following actions.

   * If you have not yet enrolled in the course, :ref:`enroll in the verified
     track<Enroll in the Verified Track>`, submit your payment information, and
     then select **Verify Now** on the payment confirmation page.

   * If you enrolled in the audit track of the course, :ref:`upgrade to the
     verified track<Upgrade to the Verified Track>`.

   * If you enrolled in the verified track and submitted payment but you have
     not yet verified your identity, on your dashboard of courses select
     **Verify Now** next to the course.

#. At the top of your browser window, a message asks you to share the camera
   with edx.org. To see and respond to this message every time you take or
   retake a photograph for the verification process, select **Share Selected
   Device**. To share the webcam throughout the process select **Always
   Share**.

#. On the **Take Your Photo** page, select the camera icon to take a photo of
   your face.

   For information about how to take a good photo, review the **To take a
   successful photo** guidelines beside your image.

#. Review your photo to make sure that it is well-lit and fills the available
   space.

   * If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake Photo**.

   * When you are satisfied with the photo, select **Next: Take a photo of your
     ID**.

#. On the **Take a Photo of Your ID** page, hold your photo ID up to the webcam
   on your computer. Make sure that the image of your ID is legible, and then
   select the camera icon to take a photo of your ID.

#. Review the photo of your ID to make sure that it is well-lit and fills the
   available space.

   * If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake Photo**.

   * When you are satisfied with the photo, select **Next: Review your
     Info**.

#. On the **Review Your Photos** page, review the photos of your face and of
   your ID. Make sure that the photos meet all of the requirements listed under
   **Photo requirements**.

   If the name on your ID is different from your edX account name, select
   **Edit Your Name**. You must edit your edX account name to exactly match the
   name on your ID.

   .. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_VerifyID_NonRoman.png
      :width: 500
      :alt: The Review Your Photos page with a photo of an ID with non-Roman
        characters and a callout indicating where the learner enters his full
        name.

   For example, if your ID shows your name in Chinese characters, but your edX
   account name appears in Roman characters, you must update your edX account
   name to match the name on your ID.

#. After you make sure that your photos meet all of the requirements listed
   under **Photo requirements** select **Confirm**.

   A message confirms that you have submitted your photos.

After edX's authorization service examines your photos, a message on your
dashboard informs you whether the verification process was successful. If the
verification process was not successful, you must submit new verification
photos. You can begin the verification process again by selecting **Verify Your
Identity**.


=====================================
Check Your ID Verification Status
=====================================

If you have enrolled in the verified certificate track for a course, your
dashboard provides the status of your ID verification.

On your dashboard, locate the course.

Your ID verification status appears with the course image for that course.
For more information, see :ref:`learners:SFD Verify Your Identity`.


==================================================
Troubleshooting the Identity Verification Process
==================================================

If you have a problem during the identity verification process, these
suggestions might help you find a resolution.

* Make sure that you are using a :ref:`supported browser<learners:Browsers>`.

  You can also switch from one browser, such as Internet Explorer or Safari, to
  another browser, such as Firefox or Chrome.

* To take photographs, the webcam uses `Adobe Flash Player`_. You might need to
  install this application or update to the latest version.
