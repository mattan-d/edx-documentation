Receiving and Sharing edX Certificates
######################################

.. The Open edX Learner's Guide also includes a Certificates topic, but it has
.. no shared content with this topic and there is no "Certificates" file in the
.. Shared folder.

Certificates show that you have successfully completed a course or program with
the required grade.

EdX course and program certificates are web certificates that you can
:ref:`share<SFD Sharing a Certificate>` and :ref:`print<Print a Web
Certificate>`. 

.. note::
  Certificates for courses completed before September 2015 are in PDF format.


The following topics provide information receiving and sharing edX certificates
that you have earned.

.. _SFD Receiving a Certificate:

***********************
Receiving a Certificate
***********************

You receive both course and program certificates automatically. After you earn
a passing grade in your course, you do not have to do anything to receive a
certificate.

For information about when certificates become available, see the following
sections.

==========================================
Receiving a Certificate for a Course
==========================================

You can access a :ref:`verified certificate<SFD Verified Certificates>` as soon
as course certificates become available.

* For :ref:`instructor-paced courses<SFD Instructor Paced>`, the date when
  certificates will become available is visible under **Certificate Available**
  in the right pane on the **Course** page. Usually, certificates will be
  available 48 hours after the course end date.

* For most :ref:`self-paced courses<SFD Self Paced>`, your certificate becomes
  available when you complete enough of the course, with a high enough grade,
  to qualify for a certificate.

.. After EDUCATOR-1101 merges (around 8/25), change "the learner dashboard and
.. the **Progress** page" to "the learner dashboard, the **Course** page, and
.. the **Progress** page".

When your course certificate becomes available, **View Certificate** options
are visible on your dashboard and the course **Progress** page. Select **View
Certificate** to open the certificate in your browser.

.. After EDUCATOR-1101 merges (around 8/25), add the Course page to the
.. following image.

      the View Certificate button.

The certificates that you have earned are also displayed on your
:ref:`Profile page<SFD Dashboard>`.

You can also print or share your certificate. For more information, see
:ref:`SFD Sharing a Certificate`.

.. _Receive a Certificate for a Program:

==========================================
Receiving a Certificate for a Program
==========================================

You automatically receive a certificate for programs (such as `MicroMasters`_,
`Professional Certificate`_ or `XSeries`_) after you earn verified
certificates in all of the individual courses in the program. Program
certificates are available immediately after you receive the verified
certificate for the final course in the program.

Program certificates that you have earned are visible on the **Programs** tab
on your dashboard and on your **Profile** page.

************************************
Downloading a Certificate (PDF only)

Certificates issued before September 2015 are in PDF format. You can download
PDF certificates.

  right corner of the page.

  your course.


.. _SFD Sharing a Certificate:

Sharing a Certificate

You can share both course and program certificates with friends, schools, or
potential employers so that they can verify that you received your certificate.
You can share a certificate in the following ways.

* Share the URL for your :ref:`web certificate<Share a Web Certificate URL>` or
  your :ref:`PDF certificate<Share a PDF Certificate URL>`. For example, you
  can send the URL in a message or post the URL on a personal website. Others
  can then visit that URL to view your certificate.
* :ref:`Share your certificate<Share Certificates on Social Media>` on social
  media, such as LinkedIn or Facebook.

.. _Share a Web Certificate URL:

===========================
Share a Web Certificate URL
===========================

.. note::
  If your certificate is a PDF certificate, see :ref:`Share a PDF Certificate
  URL`.

To share a web certificate URL, you determine the URL for the web certificate
by using one of the following methods.

Every certificate includes a unique 32-digit certificate ID. This ID is visible
at the bottom of the certificate and is part of the certificate URL.

* Use the browser address bar.

  #. Open the certificate in your browser, and then select the certificate ID.

     The certificate opens in a new browser page.

  #. Copy the URL from the browser address bar.

* Get the URL from the certificate ID.

  #. Open the certificate in your browser, and then right-click the certificate
     ID.

  #. From the menu, select **Copy Link Location**.

     The URL is copied to your computer's clipboard.

  #. Paste the clipboard contents into an email message or social media.

* Create the URL manually.

  #. Open the certificate in your browser, and then copy the certificate ID.

  #. Use the following URL, replacing ``certificate_ID`` with the certificate
     ID that you copied.

     ::

       https://courses.edx.org/certificates/<certificate_ID>

     For example, your certificate URL might resemble the following URL.

     ::

       https://courses.edx.org/certificates/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j10k11l12m13n1


.. _Share a PDF Certificate URL:

============================
Share a PDF Certificate URL
============================

If you completed a course before September 2015, your certificate is in PDF
format. For PDF certificates, you see a **Download Certificate (PDF)**
option instead of a **View Certificate** option on your dashboard.

Like web certificates, PDF certificates have a certificate URL. To determine a
PDF certificate URL, follow these steps.

#. On your learner dashboard, locate the course whose certificate you want to
   share.

#. Select **Download Certificate (PDF)**.

   The certificate opens.

The URL is visible near the bottom of the certificate. For example, the
certificate URL might resemble the following URL.

``https://verify.edx.org/cert/76558cdc28204605809a99a9dd8bafaf``

After you determine the PDF certifcate URL, you can share the URL with others.
For example, you can include the URL in an email or other message, add the URL
to your personal website, or post the URL on social media sites such as
Facebook and Twitter. Others can visit the URL to view your certificate.

final course grade.

However, your final course grade appears with other course information on your
dashboard of courses, and a complete record of your scores on all course
assignments and exams appears on the course **Progress** page. If you need a
record of your performance in a course, use your web browser to print one of
these pages.

* To access your dashboard, on the edx.org website select your public edX
  username. Your dashboard opens with a list of your courses.

* To access your **Progress** page for a course, select **View Course** next to
  the name of the course on your dashboard, and then select **Progress**.
