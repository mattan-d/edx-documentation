.. _SFD Enrolling in a Course:

####################################
Enrolling in edX Courses or Programs
####################################

EdX offers both individual :ref:`courses<About Courses>` and groups of related
courses, called :ref:`programs<About Programs>`.

You can take courses individually, even if they are part of a program. 

To learn about a course or program, click the course or program in the `edX
course catalog`_, to view its About page. About pages provide information about
the course or program, including the course or program duration, the hours of
work that you should expect to spend each week, the institution that offers the
course or program, and the cost, if applicable, for certificates or academic
credit.

For information about the types of certificates that are available and accessing
the certificates you earned, see :ref:`Certificates`.

For information about how to enroll in a certificate track for a course and how
to verify your identity for certificates, see :ref:`SFD Pursuing Certificate`.

.. _About Courses:

*****************
About edX Courses
*****************

When you consider :ref:`enrolling in an edX course<SFD Enroll in a Course>`,
you should understand these concepts.

.. _Course Availability:

============================
When is a Course Available?
============================

Every course on edx.org has a status that tells you when it is available. When
you search for courses on edx.org, you can refine your search by availability.

.. note:: You can enroll in courses which have start dates in the future, but
   you cannot access course content or assignments before the start date.

.. image:: ../../shared/images/SFD_Search_RefineByAvailability.png
   :width: 200
   :alt: The course availability options under "Refine Your Search" on edx.org.

* **Current** - the course is in session now.
* **Starting Soon** - the course will start within 60 days.
* **Upcoming** - the course will start in more than 60 days.
* **Archived** - the course has ended. You can only enroll in the audit track of
  an archived course. Once enrolled, you can access course materials, but you
  cannot receive a grade. Some features, such as course discussions and
  assignments, might not be available.

Some courses are offered at multiple times during the year. Most edX courses
are repeated, but scheduling is up to the individual course team.

If a course that you want to take is offered at other times in the future, a
**More Dates** option is available above the current course's start date
information and **Enroll Now** button. Select **More Dates** to see other
times that the course is offered, and enroll in any of the available times.

   :alt: The "more dates" option above a course's Enroll Now button.

For more information, see :ref:`course start dates<Start Date and Duration>`
and :ref:`course pacing<SFD Course Pacing>`.


.. _Course Sessions:

============================
Course Sessions
============================

A course session is the period during which a course is held. A course might
offer multiple sessions over a year. For example, a course might have two
available sessions:

* Session 1: starts September 1, 2018 and ends March 30, 2019
* Session 2: starts June 1, 2019 and ends December 30, 2020.

Not all courses offer multiple sessions. Some courses only show the currently
running session. 

Courses that show multiple sessions and the ability to change between sessions
are usually part of MicroMasters or Professional Certificate programs. For
these courses, on the **Courses** and **Programs** pages of your dashboard,
after you enroll in the course, you have options to select a session, change
to a different session, or leave a session. You must select a session before
you can access the course.

.. image:: ../../shared/images/session_select.png
   :width: 600
   :alt: A course card showing a dropdown menu with several available course
      sessions and option to leave the session and decide later.

When you enroll in the verified track for courses that offer multiple
sessions, be aware of the following policies and timeframes.

* **Upgrading From the Audit Track**

  If you were already enrolled in the audit track of a course and you purchase
  the verified track as part of a program purchase, we automatically enroll you
  in the verified track for the course, in the current session. You can change
  to a different session if the one we enrolled you in does not work for you.

* **Join a Session Within 15 Months**

  After you purchase the verified track for a course, you have 15 months from
  the date of purchase to join a course session. After 15 months, if you have
  not joined a session, your purchase expires, and you can no longer access the
  course.


* **Changing or Leaving Sessions**

  After you join a course session in the verified track (including if we
  automatically add you to a session as a result of your program purchase), you
  can change to another session or leave the session within 14 days, as long as
  you have not completed the course. For Professional Certificate courses only,
  you must change sessions or leave the session within 2 days.

  .. note:: When you change sessions, your course progress is not carried from
     your current session to the new session.

  Leaving a session is not the same as unenrolling from the course. If
  the current session does not work for you, you can leave a session and wait to
  decide on joining a later session of the course.


* **Unenrolling and Getting a Refund**

  Within 60 days from the date of purchase, you can unenroll from the course
  entirely and get a refund of your course purchase, as long as you have not
  been in a course session for more than 14 days. 

  .. note:: For Professional Certificate courses only, you must not have been in
     a course session for more than 2 days, to be able to unenroll.

  If the refund eligibility period has passed (meaning that you will not
  receive a refund when you unenroll), the unenroll option is not available.




.. _Enrollment Tracks:

===========================================
What Enrollment Tracks Does a Course Offer?
===========================================

Most edX courses offer a choice of enrollment tracks. You can choose to take
a course for free, without the option of earning a certificate, or you can
take a course for a fee, with the option of earning a verified certificate.

Course`.

Most courses offer an audit track. The audit track is free of charge, and does
not include a certificate when you complete your course. The audit track gives
you access to all course materials, including assignments and exams.

When you first enroll in a course, you are automatically enrolled in the audit
track. For information about enrolling in the audit track for a course, see

Verified Track>` in the course, you submit payment, and, some time before the
verification deadline, you must :ref:`verify your identity<SFD Verify Your
Identity>` using a webcam and a photo ID.

=============================================
Enroll in the Verified Track for a Course
=============================================

Being in the :ref:`Verified track<SFD Verified Track>` of a course means that
you are eligible to receive a certificate when you pass the course with a
required grade.

You can enroll in the verified track of a course in two ways.

* You enroll directly in the verified track of the course, if you have not yet
  enrolled in the course.

  track for the course.

Enrolling in the verified track requires that you pay for the :ref:`verified certificate<SFD Verified Certificates>` and also that you 
:ref:`verify your identity<SFD Verify Your Identity>` using a webcam and a
photo ID.

To pursue a verified certificate in a course, follow these steps.

#. In the `edX course catalog`_, courses that offer a verified track are shown
   with a "Verified" banner. Select the course that you want to take.

#. On the course About page, review information about the course including the
   price to enroll in the verified track of the course.

   information, see :ref:`SFD Verify Your Identity`.

   Order**.

Enroll in a Program
===================

There is no formal step to enroll in a :ref:`program<About Programs>`. You join

listed on the **Programs** page on your learner dashboard. Select the card for
the program to go to a page that has more information about the program. On
this page, you can view your progress through the program, enroll in more of
the program's courses, and view any certificates that you have earned.

   session. You must select a session before you can access the course.

========================
Unenroll from a Course
========================

You can drop or unenroll from a course, but it is not necessary to do so. You
can simply stop viewing and working in the course, which will remain in the list
of courses on your dashboard.

payment or 14 days after the course start date, whichever is later, you can
receive a refund for the verified track fee. For more information about getting
a refund, see :ref:`Get a Refund`.

.. note:: If you unenroll from a course, the course is deleted from
   your dashboard, and you can no longer access course content or information
   about the grade or certificate you might have earned in the course.

To unenroll from a course, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course.

#. Select the course settings icon, then select **Unenroll**. The course is removed from your dashboard.
